I am a theoretical particle physicist, currently working as a postdoctoral research scholar at Arizona State University, since October 2024. Previously, I have been a postdoctoral associate at Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech, November 2022 to October 2024.I have also been a postdoctoral fellow at UCLouvain in Belgium, from December 2021 to October 2022. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Physics from Washington University in St. Louis in December 2021 under the supervision of [Prof. Bhupal Dev](https://sites.wustl.edu/bdev/). Before joining the Ph.D program, I completed my B.E. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from University of Delhi in 2016.

Research
======
My current research primarily focuses on investigating beyond the standard model (BSM) neutrino physics especially using astrophysical probes, like in hot and dense environment of a neutron star. Top few interesting questions that keep me occupied : 
* How do neutrinos get their masses i.e. what is the elusive neutrino mass mechanism ? Does it involve right-handed neutrinos ?
* How to detect the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos ? 
* How can we detect the Cosmic Neutrino Background ? Can we devise new techniques or improve older techniques for their direct detection ? Indirect detection through their effect on the astrophysical probes?

Some other interesting open problems that fascinate me :
* What is the resolution for the short-baseline neutrino anomolies ? 
* The known values of cosmological constant (CC) and Higgs mass lead to two most important problems in physics. Are these problems connected ? Do these point to missing fundamental ingredients in QFT ?
* What is the microphysical nature of DM? Is it a fermion or a boson? Does physics at short-scales (like numerous galactic scaling laws) offer more hints on DM microphysics?
