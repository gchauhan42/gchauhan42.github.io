I am a postdoctoral associate at Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech.  I completed my Ph.D. in Physics from Washington University in St. Louis in December 2021 under the supervision of [Prof. Bhupal Dev](https://sites.wustl.edu/bdev/). Before joining my Ph.D program, I completed my B.E. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from University of Delhi in 2016.

Research
======
My research primarily focuses on investigating beyond the standard model physics (BSM) neutrino physics especially using astrophysical probes like hot and dense environment of neutron stars. Some top few interesting questions that keep me occupied : 
* How do neutrino get their masses i.e. the elusive neutrino mass mechanism ? Does it involve right-handed neutrinos?
* How to detect the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos ? 
* How can we detect the Cosmic Neutrino Background ? Can we devise new techniques or improve older techniques for their direct detection? Indirect detection through their effect on the astrophysical probes?
Some other interesting open problems that fascinates me :
* What is the resolution for the short-baseline neutrino anomolies? 
* The known values of cosmological constant(CC) and Higgs mass lead to two most important problems in physics. Are these problems connected? Do these point to missing ingredients in QFT ?
* What is the microphysical nature of DM? Is it a fermion or a boson? Does physics at galactic scale (like numerous scaling laws) offers more hints on DM microphysics?
