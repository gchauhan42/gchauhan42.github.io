I am a postdoctoral associate at Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech. My research focuses on investigating beyond the standard model physics (BSM) neutrino physics especially using astrophysical probes like hot and dense environment of neutron stars. I completed my Ph.D. in Physics from Washington University in St. Louis in December 2021 under the supervision of [Prof. Bhupal Dev](https://sites.wustl.edu/bdev/). Before joining my Ph.D program, I completed my B.E. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from University of Delhi in 2016.
